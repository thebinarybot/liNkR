## Why did I build this?

I find myself reading articles, watching videos and more in multiple devices connected to the same network. I used to share these links via WhatsApp or other modes to other devices but that felt time consuming and for really good articles I need them stored persistently in a way I can remember. Thus, the localhost link shortner.
